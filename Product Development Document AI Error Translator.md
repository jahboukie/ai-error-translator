Product Development Document: AI Error Translator
Version: 1.0
Date: July 7, 2025
Author: Gemini

## 1. Executive Summary
The AI Error Translator is a web-based utility designed to help developers, particularly "vibe coders," resolve programming errors more efficiently. Users upload a screenshot of an error, and the application uses AI to analyze it, understand the context, and generate a precise, high-quality explanation and potential solution.

The primary business goal is to increase developer productivity and reduce the financial inefficiency of "trial-and-error" interactions with subscription-based AI coding assistants.

## 2. Problem Statement
Modern developers, especially those from non-traditional backgrounds, rely heavily on intuition and rapid prototyping ("vibe coding"). This workflow is often disrupted by cryptic error messages. The key problems are:

Lack of Technical Vocabulary: Developers may not know the correct terminology to search for a solution or describe the problem to an LLM.

Inefficient Debugging: This leads to a frustrating cycle of vague queries, partial answers, and wasted time, breaking creative flow.

Wasted Resources: For developers using paid AI coding assistants (like Cursor, etc.), each failed query wastes a message from their monthly quota, representing a direct monetary loss.

The AI Error Translator will bridge the gap between a visual error and a technical solution, making debugging instantaneous and efficient.

## 3. Target Audience
The primary user is the "Vibe Coder." This persona can be characterized as:

Visually and Intuitively Driven: Prefers seeing results and iterating quickly over deep theoretical analysis.

Non-Traditional Background: May be self-taught, a designer who codes, or a product manager who builds MVPs.

AI-Reliant: Heavily uses LLMs for code generation and assistance.

Blocker-Averse: Becomes easily frustrated and loses momentum when faced with cryptic technical hurdles.

## 4. Core Features (Minimum Viable Product)
The MVP will focus exclusively on the core translation workflow.

User Story 1: Image Upload

As a user, I want to upload a PNG or JPG screenshot of my application error from my computer.

User Story 2: Natural Language Query

As a user, I want a simple text field where I can add optional context in plain English, such as "this happens when I click the submit button."

User Story 3: AI-Powered Analysis

As a user, I want to click a "Translate Error" button that triggers the AI analysis of my screenshot and text.

User Story 4: Solution Display

As a user, I want to see a clear, well-formatted response that explains what the error means and provides one or more code snippets to fix it.

## 5. Technical Architecture
The application will be built on a modern client-server architecture, relying on external AI APIs for its core intelligence.

Frontend (Client): A responsive, single-page web application (SPA). It will be responsible for the user interface and communicating with the backend via API calls.

Backend (Server): A lightweight API server responsible for handling user requests, orchestrating the AI service calls, and returning the final result to the frontend. It will be stateless to simplify scaling.

AI Services (External APIs):

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): To extract text from the uploaded image. We will use a production-grade service for accuracy.

Large Language Model (LLM): To interpret the error, understand the context, and generate the solution.

## 6. Detailed Data Flow
[Frontend] User selects an image file and types a query into the web interface. On submit, the frontend sends a POST request to the backend API, typically as a multipart/form-data payload containing the image and text.

[Backend] The backend server receives the request. It validates the input (e.g., file type, size).

[Backend → Google Vision API] The backend sends the image data to the Google Cloud Vision API's TEXT_DETECTION endpoint.

[Google Vision API → Backend] The Vision API processes the image and returns a JSON object containing all recognized text.

[Backend] The backend parses the JSON to extract the raw error string. It then constructs a final, detailed prompt.

Example Prompt for LLM:

System: You are an expert developer and debugging assistant.
User: A user encountered the following error while running their application.
Error text from screenshot: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')"
User's context: "this happens when I click the submit button on my checkout page."
Task: Please explain this error in simple terms and provide a likely solution in JavaScript/React.
[Backend → Gemini API] The backend sends this complete prompt to the Google AI (Gemini Pro) API.

[Gemini API → Backend] The Gemini API returns the generated explanation and code solution as a structured text response.

[Backend → Frontend] The backend forwards the formatted solution to the frontend.

[Frontend] The frontend displays the solution to the user in a clean, readable format, with syntax highlighting for code blocks.

## 7. Proposed Tech Stack
Frontend: React (with Vite) - For a fast, modern development experience.

Backend: Python (with FastAPI) - High-performance, easy to learn, and ideal for async operations like waiting for API responses.

OCR Service: Google Cloud Vision API

LLM Service: Google AI - Gemini API

Deployment:

Frontend: Vercel or Netlify for simple, continuous deployment.

Backend: Google Cloud Run or Render for scalable, serverless container deployment.

## 8. Post-MVP Enhancements (Future Roadmap)
IDE Integration: Develop a VS Code extension for seamless use within the editor.

Conversation History: Allow users to see their past queries and solutions.

User Accounts: Introduce user authentication to manage history and subscriptions.

Monetization: Implement a tiered subscription model using Stripe integration. Tiers could be based on the number of translations per month (e.g., Free Tier: 10/month, Pro Tier: 100/month).

Multi-language Support: Expand beyond JavaScript/Python to other common programming languages.
